Building Blocks
===============

The building blocks comprise low-level functionality that are used as
the foundation for higher-level peripherals. They contain AVR-specific
code and are targeted to specific microcontrollers.

UART
----

    #include <avrcore/uart.h>

The UART library contains primitives for communicating via the UART.


TWI
---

    #include <avrcore/twi.h>

The TWI library contains primitives for communicating via an I2C or TWI bus.
