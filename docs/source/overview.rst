Overview
========

AVRCore is a set of core tooling for common peripherals and AVR MCUs
that I use as building blocks for projects.

My toolbox currently consists of:

+ ATmega328p

+ 24LCxxx EEPROMs
+ BME280 environmental sensors
+ DS1307 real time clocks
+ SSD1306 OLED screens

The goal of this project is to build up a set of tools that I can use
to more quickly build out projects.
